This just a simple gitignore which is a place holder to create a new file. A gitignore file is no different than a plain old text file. It's just GitHub's version of this. You can delete me after a file has beem placed in thes folder. IF you ever need me again you can create a new file with the .gitignore extension or just do not delete me. If you delete me with a new file created here this file will be automatically deleted.
